## Chatfairy

This is a minimal chat application with no dependancy but Flask! I call it Chatfairy.

With only 115 locs in a singel file, Chatfairy support:

- user authentication
- multiple users chat simultaneously
- online/offline notification
- route protection

You can clone this repo and run `pip install flask && flask run`, then open `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to play with Chatfairy.
